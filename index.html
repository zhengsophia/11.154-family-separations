          <p id="text1" class="boxed scrolly-text">
            While family separations at the border were taking place long before
            the implementation of the Zero Tolerance Policy, they grew greatly
            during 2018 and the years following. This is a consequence of the
            Trump administration passing a <b>Zero Tolerance Policy</b> with regards to
            immigration from May 2018 to June 2018 after its original proposal
            in April 2018. Under the Trump administration's "zero-tolerance" policy, 
            the Department of Justice began to criminally prosecute all suspected illegal 
            border-crossers for illegal entry, even those who crossed for the first time. 
            As a result, migrants seeking entry at the border
            were arrested for any minor infraction at the discretion of border
            control. There were no exceptions to this policy, including for
            asylum seeker seeking a legal pathway to entering the country,
            and companions who were minors. This lead to widespread prosecution
            and family separations, particularly impacting Central American
            migrants from the <b>Northern Triangle</b>, countries of <b>Guatemala,
            Honduras, and El Salvador</b>. Throughout this time, there was a large
            blame game over the mistreatment of migrants trying to enter the
            country, although the separations were overwhelmingly a direct
            consequence of the policy.

            What did family separations entail?
          </h3>
          <p id="text2" class="boxed scrolly-text">
            Because of the Zero Tolerance Policy, over 3000 families were
            separated. Once reaching the border, children were sent to shelters
            run by the Department of Health and Human Services, which were
            sometimes even non profit organizations. This is despite the common
            belief that these shelters are ICE facilities. However, the
            conditions are still often inhumane, with shelters being over
            capacity and failing to meet basic health standards. Children as
            young as a few months old were separated from their parents. From a
            humanitarian standpoint, this is unacceptable, especially for a
            first world country with greater resources than these migrants'
            countries of origin have. The profit coming in from these shelters
            from family separations just shows how deportation is a billion
            dollar industry.

            When this all becomes public knowledge...
          </h3>

          <p id="text3" class="boxed scrolly-text">
            In 2018, the American Immigration Council filed a request for
            information on child separations through the Freedom of Information
            Act. As a result, they were able to obtain data sourced from ICE
            including demographics, facility locations, duration of stay, and
            reasons for separation for shelters all across the country.
          </p>

          <p id="text3" class="boxed scrolly-text">
            By analyzing this data, our group hopes to identify the lasting
            impacts of the policy even though it was only officially in place
            for a few months. Additionally, we want to bring more awareness to
            the issue of family separations at the border.
          </p>

          <h3 id="heading-3" class="scrolly-text">Interpreting the data</h3>
          <p id="text3" class="boxed scrolly-text">
            There are some key statistics that we chose to focus on within the
            dataset by displaying in our dashboard for each facility including the 
            average duration of separation and reunification rate.
            <!--  -->
            <br /><br />
            The average duration of separation across all facilities was <span style="color: #ffc300">67.8</span> days.
            <br /><br />
            The average reunification rate across all facilities was <span style="color: #ffc300">88.5%</span>.
            <br /><br />

            Although the high reunification rate seems promising, being
            separated from your families and sent to an unknown location for
            more than 2 months can be a challenging and potentially traumatic
            experience.

        <h3 id ="heading-4" class="scrolly-text"> Limitations and Nuances</h3>
            
          <p id="text4" class="boxed scrolly-text">In this piece, we attempt to compare and contrast statistics of different facilities in an effort to judge the quality 
            of each. We quickly realized that making these conclusions was difficult 
            and, in some cases, problematic. Some facilities present themselves as non-profit organizations 
            providing children with a place to stay when politics interfered in their lives. Some are not. Making 
            these distinctions can be difficult as most all facilities with online presences present themselves 
            with bright colors and feel-good quotes. For other facilities, there is no information to be found. 
            Not even location data. We were forced to exclude these obscure facilities from the map visualization below. 
            By the same token, the dataset contains little information on the conditions faced by children while within these facilities. 
            Even more discouraging is the lack of bookkeeping on the status of the discharged minors. The dataset gives information 
            on if a particular child was reunited with parents, or if they are still admitted to the facility. A third, 
            more worrying option is “discharged under other appropriate circumstances.” The vague nature of this response 
            and the fact that this option is recorded for 20-30 percent of cases on average is striking and something that 
            can cast doubt on the facility’s record-keeping abilities. Regardless, what we want to show here through the 
            visualizations is that children separated due to the zero-tolerance policy ended up at facilities across the 
            country of which we have limited information. We believe there should be more public information available about 
            different facilities so as to allow for greater accountability. We encourage users to explore the visualization, compare 
            statistics to between facilities or to the averages and do further research on particular facilities.</p>

        From the data, Cayuga Centers became the home for the most amount of
        separated children during the ZTP. Across all children that were
        reunited with their families, the average amount of time spent at the
        facility was <b>77</b> days, or around
        <b>two and a half months.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        These facilities are responsible for the lives of all these children
        without their families. Therefore it is important to ask how they are
        spending their money, and how they can provide these children with the
        best possible living experience.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="spacer"></div>
    <div id="scrollmap-content-4" class="scrollytelling-with-sidebar">
      <p>
        From the dataset we also determined that <b>9%</b> of children in this
        facility were not reported as reunited with their families. Because of
        the limitations in the dataset, their status to this day is unknown. The
        large majority, 91% of children were fortunately reunited with their
        parents, or reunited under different circumstances.
      </p>
      <p>
        While it is not necessarily the facility's responsibility to reunite
        children with their families, this data shows how important it is to
        keep children under the best conditions. Regardless of the
        circumstances, facilities with a low reunification rate may need to
        improve their conditions for those children staying there for an
        indeterminate amount of time.

        Each child has an individual story, and stayed at the facility for a

        that was <b>separated</b> but then <b>reunited</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        To further show the magnitude of the zero tolerance policy, each arc is
        color-coded depending on when the child was separated, whether
        it be before the ZTP was implemented, during its lifetime, or
        afterwards. In the legend we see that <b>72%</b> of children that stayed
        at Cayuga Centers during the study period were apprehended <b><i>during</i></b>

        Overall, a total of <b>28,766</b> days of these children's lives were

        include those children that were never reunited with their families by
        the end of the study.
